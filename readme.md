# Siplan: Institutional Strategic Planning Manager

Siplan is a web application built on the Laravel framework designed for managing Institutional Strategic Planning. It includes various modules, such as SWOT Analysis, Survey Module, Role and Permission Management, and the Standardization Management of the Health Network of the Social Security Institute of Paraguay.

## Key Modules

- **User Management with Roles and Permissions**
- **Strategic Planning**
- **SWOT Analysis**
- **Analysis of the Standard of Care in the IPS Health Network**
- **Institutional Organization Analysis**

### Group Task Management

Siplan is equipped to handle group tasks for SWOT Analysis, Group Matrix Consolidation, and the Planning Module. Within the Planning Module, you can define Mission, Vision, Values, and Key Areas within groups. At the strategic objectives level, you can assign strategies derived from the Matrix Consolidation. The system allows you to create Actions, which encompass Indicators, Baseline, Goals, and Task Responsible, based on the Organizational Chart. All of this is managed by workgroups and analyst-type users.

### PDF Consolidation

Siplan generates a comprehensive PDF consolidation report at the end of the planning process.

### Future Versions

In future versions, our objective is to implement a Management Monitoring feature with periodicity and status indicators.
